# 02456DeepDermatology
Project for course 02456 Deep Learning at DTU.

Networks has been trained on aprox. 1040 images provided by Aarhus University Hospital. Data is confidential and has not been supplied. The weights from the trained networks can be found in this repository.

The "Evaluate" notebooks are used to run new images through the networks, using the provided weights. A small directory of images sources using Google image search is provided in "Test-images". Here you can add your own images if you like, and then run the Evaluate notebook for the network you want to use to classify.

The "Train" notebooks are used to train a network for new data, for obvious reasons these will not be runable as you do not have the data. But the notebooks more or less shows how we trained our networks.
